Note: 
- For your solution, we request that you use C#, Java, Kotlin, Python, Typescript/Javascript. 
- Your application should run and work correctly against the supplied test data.

- Please use the instructions at the bottom of this email to submit your code. 
 Here are a few tips: 
  - Keep your functions/classes small. 
  - Submit code that is clean and easy to understand with appropriate documentation.


Rules: 
1.	You may NOT use any external libraries that directly solve this problem, but you may use external libraries or tools for building or testing purposes. Specifically, you may use unit-testing libraries or build tools available for your chosen language (e.g., JUnit, NUnit, Pytest, Jest, etc.). 

2.	You should NOT include any executable attachments, including those with .exe or .lib extensions. System security is very important to us and certain file extensions will be blocked for security purposes, resulting in delays to your application. We need to be able to run and build your code ourselves, so please submit your code as a zipped file of source code and supporting files, without any compiled code. If you're submitting in C#, please do not submit your code as a .msi file. 

3.	Please compress your files into a single .zip file before upload. Kindly ensure there are no executables in your submission. Our system blocks executable files for security purposes, and we want to avoid any delays in your process. (Executables include asp, bat, class, cmd, com, cpl, dll, exe, jar, jsp, jse, pif,w scr, shs, sh, vb, vbe, vbs, ws, wsc, wsf, wsh & msi)

3.	Please include a brief explanation of your design and assumptions, along with your code, as well as detailed instructions to run your application. Also include the environment required to run the application, eg. Windows, Linux.

4.	We assess a number of things including your application code design, your tests and general readability. While these are relatively small problems, we expect you to submit what you believe is production-quality code; code that you'd be able to run, maintain, and evolve. You don't need to gold plate your solution, however we are looking for something more than a bare-bones algorithm.

5.	At GIC, we highly value integrity. We also want our hiring process to be fair, and for everyone to start from the same place. To enable this, we strongly request that you do not share or publish these problems.
